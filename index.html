<h2>Our Values</h2>
<p>KOBU is a business that believes that what we have to offer goes beyond a certain good or service. We primarily aim to create value not  only economically, but emotionally and spiritually for both our  constituents and our beneficiaries. Because of this, KOBU is a deeply  value-centric organization. We aim to foster a culture of excellence both  in ourselves and others by taking actions that are congruent with certain  values.</p>

<h2>Community and Leadership</h2>
<p>First and foremost, KOBU is a believer in the power of the individual.  We believe a single person can change the world for good or ill, and when you put these individuals together, you end up with something even more powerful. <em>Community</em>, to us, is a term that ultimately refers to  people. A community can be held together by emotion, a shared set of  beliefs, or a common purpose. We aim not only to help those  communities in need, but to introduce them to the tools they need to  help themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a leader, thereâ€™s a place for you at KOBU. It takes leadership  to inspire others to effect change, and KOBU aims to be a vehicle for  that leadership. We aim not just to lead others, but to help people  discover their ability for leadership. Programs such as our project  accelerator are geared towards helping people who have the passion to  start helping their community find the talent and leadership skills inside  of themselves to execute it. In this way KOBU acts not only as a helping hand, but also as a catalyst to galvanize action in communities through an individual.</p>
